### Collaborative robotics project with peer student Matthew McDermott. 
This was for a Fall 2017 Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project at UT Austin. The code here controls a fully autonomous battery-powered Arduino robot with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance and an Adafruit AMG8833 8x8 pixel IR camera. The heat-resistant robot can search an optically opaque room for a warm body and sounds an alarm when the target is found.
