### Collaborative robotics project with peer student Matthew McDermott. 
This was for a Fall 2017 Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project at UT Austin. The code here controls a fully autonomous battery-powered Arduino robot with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance and an Adafruit AMG8833 8x8 pixel IR camera. The heat-resistant robot can search an optically opaque room for a warm body and sounds an alarm when the target is found.

The full project consisted of a robot design from scratch, beginning with customer needs analysis, design generation and selection, material selection and purchasing, budget analysis, building the entire robot, and finally writing this code to control it. The full report (~60 pages double-spaced excluding appendices, 200 pages including appendices) is available in PDF format upon request.
